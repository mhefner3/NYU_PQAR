# Mapping NYC Data (NYU PQAR 2021) 
Used in: Associations Between COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy and Socio-Spatial Factors in NYC Transit Workers 50 Years and Older


## Introduction 
This project was done with faculty at New York University in the Pipelines in Quantitative Aging Research summer program. 
In March, 2020, New York City (NYC) transit workers were suddenly thrust into the role of essential workers by continuing to report to work as usual during the COVID-19 pandemic. These employees provided a “pandemic lifeline” to NYC, making it possible for thousands of other essential workers to continue to commute, thereby enabling the city to keep functioning. While the full impact of this commitment on transit workers’ health and wellbeing is still unfolding, we know that this workforce, the largest in the US, with over 70K employees, experienced high rates of infection (15% reported in May, double the general population), high rates of hospitalizations, quarantine or home isolation of workers (>10K), and a large number of deaths, with 135 recorded MTA worker deaths as of January, 2021. Furthermore, throughout this ordeal, many frontline transit workers experienced verbal abuse and physical assault by riders over mask use, and others reported on-the-job stigmatization related to their race and ethnicity. At the same time, many transit workers mourned the loss of family members, friends, and co-workers.

To better understand the impact of the pandemic on this intensely affected workforce, we conducted a pilot study of TWU members in August, 2020. Working in close collaboration with the leadership of the Transport Workers Union (TWU) Local 100, we collected survey data from 645 TWU members. The demographics of our sample closely matched that of the TWU Local 100 membership in terms of gender (predominantly male), race and ethnicity (predominantly Black and Hispanic), and age (average 51 years).
